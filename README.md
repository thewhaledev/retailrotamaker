# Retail Rota Maker
A Python program that automates the production of daily rotas, primarily using openpyxl.

## Notes

This program was used for the rotas at my own workplace, please note that the names have been changed for privacy reasons.

Due to this program being used for my own workplace, the usage of it is geared towards the needs of that environment.
